# anoxia
A short browser game for the game jam "Â¡Tu juego a juicio jam!"
The theme for this game jam was "Demasiado largo" (Too long), so I made a game about a an underground autogenerated maze you have to escape from. You depend on an oxygen tube to stay alive, the tube has to be connected to and oxygen source (there are several around the maze) which will limit how far you can move, you can disconnect by using but you'll eventually run out of oxygen ): get to the right-bottom corner of the maze to escape.

## controls
Usa [W] [A] [S] [D] to move

[ESPACIO] connect or disconnect from oxygen source

[CLIC] to shoot
